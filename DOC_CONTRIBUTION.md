# Documentation Contributions

Contribute directly to the SailPoint developer documentation whenever you want! 

You can make edits to existing documents or contribute new ones to provide information about anything you think others would find useful, like a tip or trick or a cool new tool like a custom connector. You can contribute directly to the [repository](https://github.com/sailpoint-oss/developer.sailpoint.com), create a pull request, and we'll check it out! We'll review it for accuracy, necessity, and relevance, and if we approve, we'll merge it in and find a place for it on the site. Whatever you can think of, we're grateful for your help to expand and improve the SailPoint developer documentation.

## Developer Documentation

To make changes to the SailPoint developer documentation, follow the same process you would to make any other code change: 

- Fork the repository and copy only the main branch. 
- Pull down the code, build, and ensure it's running properly. 
- Create a new branch from main, using either of two naming conventions: `fix/your-fix-name` for fixes or `feature/your-feature-name` for features. 
- Create a pull request from your branch to our origin repository's main branch!

Any developer documentation you contribute must be written in Markdown to be accepted.

If you want to request the changes, use GitHub Issues to either report a bug or request a feature: 
- To request a correction or an update to developer documentation, [report it as a bug](https://github.com/sailpoint-oss/developer.sailpoint.com/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=bug-report.md&title=%5BBug%5D+Your+Bug+Report+Here). 
- To request new content in the developer documentation, [request it as a feature](https://github.com/sailpoint-oss/developer.sailpoint.com/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=feature-request.md&title=%5BFeature%5D+Your+Feature+Request+Here).

## API Specifications 

The developer site pulls the API specifications from a separate repository where they're generated, so you can't make direct changes to them. However, we encourage you to use GitHub Issues to reach out about changes you want to make to improve the API specifications. We'll review your requests and make the improvements as soon as possible. 

## Documentation Standard Practices

We have a number of documentation standard practices, some of which are necessary for quality, and some of which are just stylistic choices we've made. We'll always accept good documentation, even if it doesn't necessarily follow all these standards, but we'll either edit the contribution or request edits from you before we accept it. You can use the following list as a reference for some reasons we may edit your contribution: 

- Use [active voice](https://developers.google.com/style/voice) whenever possible.
- Use [present tense](https://developers.google.com/style/tense) whenever possible.
- Use the [second person ("you")](https://developers.google.com/style/person). 
- Avoid using [jargon](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/word-choice/avoid-jargon). 
- Avoid wordiness. 
- Use [common contractions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/word-choice/use-contractions). 
- Use [prepositions where they feel natural](https://developers.google.com/style/prepositions).
- Use complete sentences, except in lists and field descriptions. 
- Avoid using [ambiguous pronouns](https://developers.google.com/style/pronouns#ambiguous-pronoun-references).
- Avoid [dangling and misplaced modifiers](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/grammar/dangling-misplaced-modifiers). 
- Use [title-style capitalization](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/capitalization#title-style-capitalization) for headings.
- Use one space between sentences. 
- Use double quotes for messages. 
- Use single quotes for UI elements like buttons and tabs. 
- Use backticks for code snippets. 

In general, if you have a question about grammar, punctuation, or style while you're writing, the [Google Developer Documentation Style Guide](https://developers.google.com/style) and the [Microsoft Style Guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/welcome/) are good references, and our standards are generally consistent with theirs.
